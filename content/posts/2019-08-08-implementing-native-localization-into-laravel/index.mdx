I have an idea foe the next version of loki. Loki is my localization package for Laravel.

I'm thinking of doing a deeper integration of Loki into Laravel. Maybe I can extend the current route class with my own which will have appropriate methods and functionality.

Then what you could do is:

```php
Route::get('/about', 'PageController@about')->name('about')->locale('en');
```

This create a route for the english locale for the about page.

Then for a different language:

```php
Route::get('/o-nama', 'PageController@about')->name('about')->locale('hr');
```

The en about url would be `/about` and the hr about url would be `/o-nama`.

Or you could not use localized urls and just add the locale to the route

```php
Route::get('/about', 'PageController@about')->name('about')->locale(['en', 'hr']);
```

Then the urls would be:

```
/about
/hr/about
```

If you would to disable hide default locale then the en url would be:

```
/en/about
```

The locale method would apply correct locale middleware to the route once entered.
