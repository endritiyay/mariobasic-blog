After I closed my website, stopped offering subscriptions for tutorials, and closed down my blog I focused on two big projects. First one is [Visit Murter - Tourist Info Portal](https://visitmurter.com/) which I started with my brother, and the second one is for a company in ≈†ibenik called [G.I.M. Gase - Fire Extinguisher Service Company](https://gimgase.hr/).

Other than that, at the end of 2018. I got my little baby girl called Sofia ‚ù§Ô∏è. She is on the cover image of this post. I'm still adjusting to the whole parenthood, but I can proudly say that I change diapers like a pro now üòä.

## Visit Murter

My brother and I started a company called [Go Visit](https://govisit.hr/) and our main product is a web application called Visit Murter. Visit Murter provides up-to-date information to tourists about activities, events, places and accommodations on the island of Murter. It covers all four villages: Murter, Tisno, Betina and Jezera.

We charge businesses on the island to be on the website and in return we connect them with tourists over email, phone, social networks and location on map. In addition to that the application supports paid advertisments on selected pages. eg. There is a page for a beach in Murter and a client wants to put an ad for his apartments on that page. There is also a section for news and articles, so that the tourists are informed about the happenings that concern them.

The application is now almost complete, but there are a lot more things that we want to add, improve, change in the future.

We have also started to offer the whole SaaS platform to other communities. [Send us a message](https://govisit.hr/zatrazite-sastanak) if you are interested in more details.

## G.I.M. Gase

I think that this is the most complex project that I have built with Laravel and React.js so far. The code is not complex, but the business logic is and every part of the application has to run flawlessly.

The owner of the company contacted me, and said that he has a vision, and wanted me to help him realize it. Since this is an ongoing project and kept very secretly I can't tell anything more.

## Personal stuff

Let's just say that my lifestyle before the baby was very different than it is now. I still drive my motorcycle and other things that I did before, but I had to adopt new obligations and stop living from project to project and find a steady income. I'm still working on this last one...
