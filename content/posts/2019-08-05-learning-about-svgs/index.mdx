excerpt: In order to change the logo on this Gatsby theme I need to use have a logo in SVG format. Not only that I don't have a logo in SVG, but I also don't have a logo for this blog yet.

I have found this theme [Novela](https://novela.narative.co/) for Gatsby on Twitter. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela). I really liked it so, I tried installing it. I failed many times because this was my first time using Gatsby. Then, after checking issues on GitHub and asking some questions I got better documentation which got me started and here we are.

## Changing the logo

Then only thing that I wanted to change except the social links (which I have managed to do) is change the logo. Now, in the readme file on GitHub you will find instructions on how to do this. I've managed to use component shadowing (a Gatsby way of overriding components from the theme), but I got stuck on providing my logo SVG.

### SVGs

No clue what to do here. I have my Laravelista logo in `.ai` format which I can save to `.svg` format, but then when I open the file with VS Code I get some jibberish which does not work. I need to take some time to study how SVGs work and how to create a SVG file which will work with this theme. Also, I would like to be able to change the color of the logo depending on the theme mode (the theme currently has this already).

**I'll keep updating this post as I go along.**
